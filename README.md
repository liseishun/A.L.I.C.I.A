# A.L.I.C.I.A
Project A.L.I.C.I.A is my project to learn how to create cmd interface by using click library and learn how to hash using bcrypt

Features & Functionalities:

Visual Appeal: Through intricate ASCII art, users are visually engaged as they navigate different functionalities. Each major action is greeted with unique ASCII designs, making the experience memorable.

Secure Password Management:

Users are prompted to input passwords, which are subsequently evaluated for strength. To ensure robust security, various criteria like length, character variety, and avoidance of predictable sequences are considered.
Strong passwords are saved in a temporary file, ensuring a quick and easy retrieval.
For users wishing to bolster their security, the option to convert this stored password into a hashed format using bcrypt is provided.
Personalized Greeting: In the absence of command-line flags, the program offers a personal touch by soliciting the user's name and responding with a customized greeting.
